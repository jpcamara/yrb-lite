  # y-websocket protocol over ActionCable.
  #
  # Include this module in an ActionCable channel to sync Y.js documents
  # (and awareness/presence) with browser clients. Messages are the standard
  # y-protocols binary messages, base64-encoded in a JSON envelope:
  #
  #   { "update" => "<base64 bytes>", "id" => 42 } # client -> server
  #   { "update" => "...", "origin" => "<id>" }    # server -> subscribers
  #   { "ack" => 42 }                              # server -> sender
  #
  # Example:
  #   class DocumentChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  #     include YrbLite::ActionCable::Sync
  #
  #     on_load { |key| Document.find_by(key: key)&.content }
  #     # on_change blocks run in the channel instance's context, so instance
  #     # methods (current_user, params, ...) are available without plumbing:
  #     on_change { |key, update| Document.record!(key, update, by: current_user) }
  #
  #     def subscribed
  #       sync_for params[:id]
  #     end
  #

  #       sync_unsubscribed
  #     end
  #   end

  # validated against `on_load`, recorded through `on_change`, then broadcast.
  # No authoritative document state is kept in ActionCable process memory.
